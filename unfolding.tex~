\section{Unfolding}
The effects of imperfect detector resolution can in general have an non-negligible impact on the shape of the distribution of the measured observables. For this reason, in case of the differential cross sections measurements, a procedure to correct for the detection efficiencies and
 resolution effects is applied. Throughout this document, this procedure will be referred to as
 the unfolding procedure, and the unfolded differential distributions will be referred to as distributions at the fiducial level. 
 Currently adopted procedure is ``bin-by-bin unfolding''. It is aimed we would also perform matrix inversion method as a validation tool for preceding method.

Examples of the efficiency matrices for gluon fusion and VBF production can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:eff2d}. The matrices for the $\pt_{\rm H}$ and N(jets) observables are shown.
