Particle-Flow based isolation is  used for the muons.
%described for electrons in section~\ref{sec:eleiso},  
The so-called $\Delta\beta$ correction is applied in order to subtract the pileup contribution for the muons, 
%The only difference with electrons is the way the pileup contribution is subtracted: for the muons,  
whereby $\Delta\beta = \frac{1}{2} \sum^\text{charged had.}_\text{PU} \pt$  gives an estimate of the energy deposit of neutral particles (hadrons and photons) from pile-up vertices. 
The relative isolation for muons is then defined as:
\begin{equation}
\text{RelPFiso} = \frac{\sum^\text{charged had.} \pt + \max(\sum^\text{neutral had.} \ET 
+ \sum^\text{photon} \ET - \Delta \beta, 0)}{\pt^\text{lepton}}
\label{eqn:mupfiso}
\end{equation}

The isolation working point for muons was optimized in Ref.~\cite{AN-15-277} and the working point was chosen to be the same as electrons,
namely $\text{RelPFiso}(\Delta R = 0.3) < 0.35$.
