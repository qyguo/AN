 In order to ensure that the leptons are consistent with a common primary vertex we require that they have an associated track with a small impact parameter with respect to the event primary vertex.  
We use the significance of the impact parameter to the event vertex, $  {\rm SIP_{3D}} = \frac{\rm IP}{\sigma_{\rm IP}} $, where ${\rm IP}$ is the lepton impact parameter in three dimensions at the point of closest approach with respect to the primary interaction vertex, and $\sigma_{\rm IP}$ the associated uncertainty.  Hereafter, a "primary lepton" is a lepton satisfying $| {\rm SIP_{3D}} | < 4$.
