\section{Results}

In this section, we describe the methods used for the estimation of the significance of the excess of events above the SM backgrounds observed in the low-mass region, and of the signal strength, i.e. its cross section normalized to the one expected for a SM Higgs.

To exploit all the properties of the resonance under study or search, a multi-dimensional fit is implemented.
%For each of the categories defined in Section~\ref{sec:categorization}, two variables are used in the maximum likelihood fit, namely:
For each of the categories defined in Section~\ref{sec:categorization}, the variable used in the maximum likelihood fit is the four-lepton mass without kinematic refitting $\mllll$. 
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item The four-lepton mass without kinematic refitting $\mllll$, %or the refitted mass $m_{4\ell}'$ ;
%%\item A kinematical discriminant $K_D$, where $K_D = \DbkgVBFdec$ for VBF-2 jets tagged category, $\DbkgVHdec$ for VH-hadronic tagged category and $\KD$ for all other categories.
%% $\KD$, except in VBF-2jet and VH-hadronic categories where $\DbkgVBFdec$ and $\DbkgVHdec$ are used instead. (\textbf{FIXME: not yet in the results below}).
%\end{enumerate}

%To account for the strong correlation of the kinematic discriminant with the mass, a 2D histogram template of $K_D$ vs. $\mllll$ is implemented.
%Due to the small number of expected events in the mass peak, the mass dimension is unbinned and the resolution model is used as described in section \ref{sec:signalshapes}. 
%The total PDF is defined as:
%\begin{equation}
%%\mathcal{L}_{2D}(m_{4l},\KD)  =\mathcal{L}(m_{4l}) \mathcal{L}(\KD|m_{4l}) ,
%\mathcal{L}_{2D}(m_{4l},K_D)  =\mathcal{L}(m_{4l}) \mathcal{L}(K_D|m_{4l}) ,
%\end{equation}
%where the first factor corresponds to the 1D mass PDF and the second factor to the 2D template of mass vs. kinematic discriminant. 
%The conditional term in the second factor is implemented in the template by normalizing all columns corresponding to the same mass to the same value each. 
%Therefore, the 2D template doesn't include any information on the mass, but given the mass, it provides information on the kinematic discriminant.
%2D Templates for $\DbkgVBFdec$ and $\DbkgVHdec$ vs $m_{4l}$ are computed in 7x20 bins, for all processes. 
%2D Templates for $\KD$ vs $m_{4l}$ are computed in 35x30 bins in the Untagged categories. The same templates are also used for VH-leptonic and ttH tagged categories.
%Based on the seven event categories and the three final states ($4\mu$, $4e$, $2e2\mu$), the $(\mllll, K_D)$ unbinned distributions of selected events are split into $22\times3=66$ categories.
